> Hi there - I'm Victoria Rudakova, currently working as a software engineer at [Density](https://www.density.io/). This blog was mainly created during my time working as a researcher at the [Graphics lab](http://graphics.cs.yale.edu/site/) of Yale University. You will find some past articles on computer graphics, computer vision and user interaction.
